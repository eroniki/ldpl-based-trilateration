Location fingerprinting dataset collected in measurement session reported in the following paper:

Jekabsons G., Zuravlyov V. Refining Wi-Fi based indoor positioning. Proceedings of 4th International Scientific Conference Applied Information and Communication Technologies (AICT), ISBN: 978-9984480220, Jelgava, Latvia, 2010, pp. 87-95.

The data contains measurements for 82 calibration points (training data set) and 68 test points (test data set).

Variables:

calibAvgRSS - RSS values for calibration points (averaged values from all four measuring orientations)
calibAvgXY - x and y coordinates of calibration points with RSS values stored in calibAvgRSS
calibAvgRoomID - IDs for classrooms, offices, and hallway for positioning in room-level granurality (classification)
calibRSS - RSS values for calibration points (4 values for each point - North, East, South, West - averaged over 30 measurements taken in 30 seconds)
calibXY - x and y coordinates of calibration points with RSS values stored in calibRSS

testRSS - RSS values for test points (averaged over 30 measurements taken in 30 seconds)
testXY - x and y coordinates of test points
testRoomID - IDs for classrooms, offices, and hallway
testOrient - orientations for the test points (1=North, 2=East, 3=South, 4=West)

ind5AP_2_4 - indexes for the 5 strongest access points working in 2.4 GHz band
ind5AP_5 - indexes for the 5 strongest access points working in 5 GHz band
ind5AP_All - indexes for the 5 strongest access points working in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands

ind14AP_2_4 - indexes for the 14 local access points working in 2.4 GHz band
ind14AP_5 - indexes for the 14 local access points working in 5 GHz band
ind14AP_All - indexes for the 14 local access points working in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands

ind57AP_2_4 - indexes for all sensed access points working in 2.4 GHz band
indOutsideOnly - indexes for only the outside access points (in buildings nearby)
